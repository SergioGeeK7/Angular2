<h3>
  {{title}}
  <img src="{{heroImageUrl}}" style="height:30px">

We use interpolation to weave calculated 
strings into the text between HTML element tags
and within attribute assignments.

More generally, the material between the braces
is a template expression that Angular first evaluates 
and then converts to a string. The following interpolation 
illustrates
the point by adding the two numbers within braces:

<!-- "The sum of 1 + 1 is 2" -->
<p>The sum of 1 + 1 is {{1 + 1}}</p>
<!-- "The sum of 1 + 1 is not 4" -->
<p>The sum of 1 + 1 is not {{1 + 1 + getVal()}}</p>
